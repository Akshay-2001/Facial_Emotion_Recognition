Face emotion recognition, also known as facial emotion detection, is a technology that uses 
computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically identify and analyze the 
emotional expressions displayed on a person's face.

This guide will assist you in setting up the necessary components to run a face emotion
detection system on your machine. Please follow the steps below:

Step 1: Prerequisites

Before running the model directly we need to have the following prerequisites:

	1. Python 3.7 or later: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download
	   it from the official Python Website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
	
	2. Pip : Pip is a package management system for python. It usually comes pre-installed
	   with Python, but you can chekc its presence by running 'pip --version' in 
	   command prompt.

	3. Anaconda Navigator: This is an easy to use Python and data science platform, which 
	   is used for managing and launching application, environments and packages. You can 
	   download its appropriate distribution for you operating system from Anaconda 
	   website (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). You can read the details 
 	   for installing anaconda on Anaconda documentation website 
	   (https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/).

Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following commands:
	pip install opencv-python numpy
	pip install keras
	pip install streamlit
	pip install pandas
	pip install seaborn
	pip install scikitplot
	pip install keras
	pip install tensorflow

Step 2: Install Spyder IDE

Spyder IDE should be installed during the installation of Anaconda if not do the following:

1. Open your anaconda terminal or anaconda prompt.
2. Run the following commands:
	conda update conda
	conda install spyder=5.4.3

Step 3: Running the Face Emotion Detection

1. Open your terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the directory where the face emotion detection file is saved.
   (In this case it is saved in "F:\Final Year Project\FER")
3. Run the following command to start the face emotion detection system:
	python main.py

   This  will launch the application, and you will be able to see the real-time face 
   emotion decection output.

Note: Make sure to provide appropriate permissions to access the camera 
	when prompted by the system.
